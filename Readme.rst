Perspective Undistorter
#######################

This script allows you to create a persectively undistorted image, that, when
viewed from a certain angle, looks like it is not perspectively distorted, even
though it should. This is for example useful, when you want to paint something
on the road, such that passing drivers can read it without effort.
